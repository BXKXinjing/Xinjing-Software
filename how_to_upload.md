#### (hell for sure we all dont know)

1) first here, hit this tiny tiny **"plus button"**...
2) watch the **"Upload files"** button drops and hit it...

_(then wait the page load...)_

3) hit the **"choose your files"** to open up a window _(3A)_, or _drag_ your files to this big box _(3B)_...
4) title your upload...
5) add descriptions to your upload...
6) ONLY IF YOU WANT TO **START A SERIOUS DISCUSSION** CHOOSE THE **"Create a new branch"**, OTHERWISE CHOOSE **"Commit directly"**.
7) hit that green **"Commit changes"** button...

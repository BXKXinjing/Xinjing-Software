# Ugh this is the README.md for Software group(repo)

### Please notice that **"repo"** is different to the root **"organization"**.

Please do upload files here for further interactions.

We recommend keep files in:

**1)** make a dedicate folder ``./<part>`` for your code (yep never put it on the root).

**2)** upload your code/data into your folder with this name: ``<part_name>-<version>.<format>``, where your version could be like _-0.1_, _-1.5b_, etc..

**3)** **save a copy** (and possibly **replace the original**) as ``<part_name>.<format>`` (or u may say _"omit the version"_) within the folder (so others may call ``./<part>/<part_name>.<format>`` to reach your file).

Subfolders (for dedicated program config/data/log storage) is encouraged.

We welcome for any changes, and better quick but thorough changes.

<br>

Remind of your time always. :)

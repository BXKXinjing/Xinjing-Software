# Ugh this is the README.md for Software group(repo)

### Please notice that **"repo"** is different to the root **"organization"**.

Please do upload files here for further interactions.

~~We recommend keeping files like...~~(ugh cuz Storine told that this is not such practical by some mean so ignore this, just see the "how to upload".)

~~1) make a dedicate folder ``./<part>`` for your code (yep never put it on the root).~~

~~2) upload your code/data into your folder with this name: ``<part_name>-<version>.<format>``, where your version could be like _-0.1_, _-1.5b_, etc..~~

~~3) **save a copy** (and possibly **replace the original**) as ``<part_name>.<format>`` (or u may say _"omit the version"_) within the folder (so others may call ``./<part>/<part_name>.<format>`` to reach your file).~~

Subfolders (for dedicated program config/data/log storage) is encouraged.

We welcome for any changes, always.

# Really don't you know how to do upload??
#### (hell for sure we all dont know)

#### A. to upload a file...

1) open the main page of this repo (click the **"<> Code"** section)...
2) find a tiny **"plus button"** on the main page then hit it (i bet u can find it, it's just beside a big green dropbox)...
3) hit the **"Upload files"**...
4) hit the **"choose your files"** to open up a window _(3A)_, or _drag_ your files to this big box _(3B)_...
5) title your upload action...
6) add descriptions to your upload...
7) ONLY IF YOU WANT TO **START A SERIOUS DISCUSSION** CHOOSE THE **"Create a new branch"**, OTHERWISE CHOOSE **"Commit directly"**.
8) hit that green **"Commit changes"** button...
9) and you are done with the upload.

#### B. and if you want to create(make) a file (awa folder):

1) this time hit the **"plus button"** you've seen before...
2) hit the **"Create new file"**...
3) write like... well if your desired save place is like ``"./<path>/<path2>.../<filename>"``, write ``"<path/<path2>.../<filename>"`` in the location box (sure u can find it, just above the edit headers, on the left, after the branch name and a slash)...
4) (and if u want to make a **folder**, make it like creating a new empty file with a random name in ur desired folder.)
5) hit the **"Commit changes..."**...
6) again ONLY IF YOU WANT TO **START A SERIOUS DISCUSSION** CHOOSE THE **"Create a new branch"**, OTHERWISE CHOOSE **"Commit directly"**.
7) write your honest changes, then hit **"Commit changes"**...
8) and you are done setting up a file (maybe with folders).

#### C. ever if you want to edit a file (awa to change the path of it):

1) click into the preview page of the file...
2) find a **"pen button"** on the top right corner, within the preview box heading, and hit it...
3) write changes to the file as you like it...
4) (and for a path change, follow B.3 to find the box, change that to ur desired path and dont forget'bout ur filename at last.)
5) then follow B.5) to B.7)...
6) and you are done changing a file (maybe with its path).

#### D. and you dare deleting a file:

1) click into the preview page of the file...
2) find a **"..."***(we call it "menu") button on the top right corner, above the preview box heading and a chainging list, and hit it...
3) hit the **"Delete file"**...
4) follow B.5) to B.7)...
5) and you are done deleting a junk (hope that's really a junk to you).

and that's the end of this tutor.

sorry but can't find an easier way to copy-paste files here, ignore that, patience for your extra uploads :(

<br>

(cuz before i search for markdowns and trying to upload my very own file ima dumb also)

(i really cant figure out how git stores each file into hashtags for locations instead of folders aaaahhhhh)

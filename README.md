# Ugh this is the README.md for Software group(repo)

### Please notice that **"repo"** is different to the root **"organization"**.

Please do upload files here for further interactions.

We recommend keeping files like...

1) make a dedicate folder ``./<part>`` for your code (yep never put it on the root).
2) upload your code/data into your folder with this name: ``<part_name>-<version>.<format>``, where your version could be like _-0.1_, _-1.5b_, etc..
3) **save a copy** (and possibly **replace the original**) as ``<part_name>.<format>`` (or u may say _"omit the version"_) within the folder (so others may call ``./<part>/<part_name>.<format>`` to reach your file).

Subfolders (for dedicated program config/data/log storage) is encouraged.

We welcome for any changes, and better quick but thorough changes.

_(then wait the page load...)_

3) hit the **"choose your files"** to open up a window _(3A)_, or _drag_ your files to this big box _(3B)_...
4) title your upload...
5) add descriptions to your upload...
6) ONLY IF YOU WANT TO **START A SERIOUS DISCUSSION** CHOOSE THE **"Create a new branch"**, OTHERWISE CHOOSE **"Commit directly"**.
7) hit that green **"Commit changes"** button...

8) and you are done and up.

#### and if you want to make a folder:

1) this time hit the **"plus button"** you've seen before...
2) hit the **"Create new file"**...
3) write like... well if your path to create is ``./<path1>/<path2>/`` then u shall type: ``<path1>/<path2>/<a_random_name>`` (yup this is a random name, just for placeholding) in the location bar (im sure u can find it)...
4) hit the **"Commit changes..."**...
5) write anything'bout the change (better "create a folder" not a file), then hit **"Commit changes"**...
6) and you are done setting up a folder.


and that's the end of this tutor.
